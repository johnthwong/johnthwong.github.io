## Microsimulations

### [Agent-Based General Equilibrium Model](https://github.com/johnthwong/bi-exchange)
An agent-based model of a general bilateral exchange problem of any *A* agents and any *N* goods. This model uses boundedly rational agents, in the sense that the agents iteratively make trades without knowing the optimal quantities that maximize their utility. It can obtain a decentralized, numerical solution to a general equilibrium problem. [View on Github](https://github.com/johnthwong/bi-exchange)

### [Modeling the Distributional Impact of Treating Employer FICA Taxes as Employee's Taxable Income](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=79249&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps)
I coded a reform in PolicyEngine's microsimulation model. This reform, floated by others, exempts Social Security benefits from taxation while treating the employerâ€™s share of Social Security and Medicare taxes as additional taxable income for employees. This further shifts the burden of financing retirement programs to working-age adults, and we model its impact on federal deficits and inequality.

## In Peer Review

### [The Causal Effect of Regulation on Economic Growth: Evidence From the US States](https://github.com/johnthwong/reg-growth/blob/3a239c586cdf3bfa44faa8478f17fcceec967a04/write-up.pdf)
I wrote a paper with [Patrick McLaughlin](https://patrickamclaughlin.com) on using state age to estimate how increasing regulation causally affects growth. This project leverages the QuantGov project's [State RegData](https://www.quantgov.org).

## Working Papers/Works in Progress

### [The Problem With Historical Instrumental Variables](https://github.com/johnthwong/mendelian/blob/main/presentation.pdf)
Many instrumental variable papers that study are misspecified. I use difference equations and VAR representations to analyze how these papers violate econometric assumptions, and prove my claim with Monte Carlo simulations. I also propose a remedial two-stage-least-squares specification to correct for bias. [Read more](https://github.com/johnthwong/mendelian/blob/main/presentation.pdf)

### [How Complex Has the Tax Code Become? A Measure Derived from Tax Liability](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policy-complexity)
I construct a direct empirical measure of tax code complexity that encompasses the incidence of all federal and state taxes and the utilization of all deductions and credits. [View on Github](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policy-complexity)

### Learning What We Like

### Social Security: Cost-Benefit Measured as Expected Spending Per Unit of Risk Reduction
I investigate whether various Social Security programs, in conjunction, provide additional value of risk insurance per dollar that is overlooked by separate evaluations of each program. I am using Health and Retirement Study panel data to examine how much the beneficiaries of retirement and disability income payments overlap.

### How Monopolistic is iMessage?
To what extent does iMessage confer a monopolistic advantage to Apple? I estimate how much the service changes the demand elasticity for iPhones.

### [What Is the Cause of Interest Rate Volatility in Interbank Markets?](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)
I demonstrate in this analysis that contrary to conventional wisdom, interest rate volatility isn't caused by liquidity crunches subsequent to initial public offerings. [Read more](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)

### Income Mobility and Regulation: Evidence from Canadian Immigrants
Using a panel of measures of immigrant mobility from Statistics Canada and a shift-share instrument, we measure how much liberalization affects immigrants' economic outcomes. With Vincent Geloso and James Dean.

### [Most U.S. Government Borrowing Just Pays for More Borrowing](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/most-u-s-government-borrowing-just-pays-for-more-borrowing/)
Nearly 40 percent of U.S. government debt today was issued just to cover interest on previous debt, and this problem is poised to worsen as recent borrowing accrues interest and Congress further cuts revenue.

### [Web Scraper for Subsidized Housing Transaction Data](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)
The Housing Authority's data on subsidized housing transactions is notoriously difficult to access as the data must be requested by month, each with a separate web form. So I developed a scraper that automatically submits forms and gathers transaction count in each month into one spreadsheet. [View on Github](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)

### [Visualization of the Hong Kong's Forex Reserves](https://github.com/johnthwong/hkma)
After a drop in the balances of accounts held at the central bank by commercial banks (aka "Aggregate Balance") in the summer of 2022, there was [trepidation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/hong-kong-liquidity-shrinks-50-since-may-amid-currency-defense) that Hong Kong's currency peg with the USD would break. In response, I wrote an internal report on why "Aggregate Balance" is insignificant and not worth panicking over. [View on Github](https://github.com/johnthwong/hkma)

### [Give Public Housing Residents the Right to Buy Their Flat](https://johnthwong.github.io/page_tpo)
I submitted a policy memo to the Federation of American Scientists' call for federal policy ideas for increasing housing supply. By selling public housing units, we can unlock currently non-transferrable land value, increase homeownership, create new wealth that accrues to the poor, improve state and local public finances, free up units under the Faircloth Limit, and most of all, increase housing supply.
