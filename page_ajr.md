## Equal Liberal Rights Drive Growth

*As part of my application to Mercatus Center's MA Fellowship, I drew on works by Daron Acemoglu and Mancur Olson to argue that equal rights are necessary for growth. I replicated Acemoglu et al.'s classic study on the effects of colonial institutional quality on modern-day growth. I use an updated dataset on growth and replace the treatment variable (originally expropriation risk) with Freedom House's country-level indices on both the quality of democracy and civil liberties. Turns out, better political and civil rights on their own can drive even more growth than just better property rights alone. See the full essay below:*

This essay will argue that institutions play a major role throughout the lifecycle of societies, through both their rise and decline. I will first summarize empirical research by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (AJR) on the role of institutions in the economic trajectories of former colonies and evidence on coalition capture offered by Mancur Olson as an explanation for stagnation observed in developed countries. The unifying factor underlying these dynamics is the emergence of extractive institutions. I then replicate AJR’s results to argue that a broad class of liberal rights is necessary for economic growth. 

AJR (2002) found that the degree of urbanization of a country in the 16th century strongly predicts low per-capita income today—essentially a reversal of fortune.[^1]  This finding offers a fascinating parallel to Olson’s findings on US states—that the more a state was urbanized in 1880, the slower it grew between 1965-80 in aggregate and per-capita terms.[^2]  Despite these two works essentially studying two opposite ends of the lifecycle of societies, both find a reversion in economic growth. Extractive institutions are the cause of decline in both instances. 

In the former case, AJR (2001) used the instrumental variable of settler mortality to isolate the part of institutional quality that is driven by colonial settlers. Western settlers were more likely to introduce good institutions in places that they populate in large numbers, which in turn has a significant positive impact on level differences in income today.[^3] What are these good institutions? The authors characterized them as broad-based and well-enforced property rights, which guard against expropriation of returns and thereby encourage investment.[^4] Moving from the 1st to 3rd quartile in the strength of a country’s property rights can increase GDP per capita by 5 times (see Table 2).

For developed countries, the institutions in question are wider than those of the state. Olson observed that in stable societies, an extractive type of private institutions in the form of “distributional coalitions” form.[^5] These are organizations which broadly restrict competitive markets in various ways. They can take the form of price-setting cartels, but also associations which set professional standards to restrict entrants, or which lobby the state for complex regulations and tax laws that benefit themselves.[^6] By restricting competition, distributional coalitions can restrict quantity supplied, set prices, and capture additional surplus at the expense of other market participants’ right to contract. Insulated from competition, economic actors are less willing to adopt new technologies and the economy becomes slow to reallocate resources to changing conditions.[^7]

At this point, it is critical to note that AJR were discussing the same dynamic as Olson. AJR emphasized that *both property rights and its equality* were jointly necessary for creating conditions which allowed agrarian societies to enter industrialization. Unequal property rights are extractive because not only do they enable expropriation of private rewards, but they also grant exclusive access to assets and create monopolies, such as that observed in Latin American mining industries. Taken together, unequal property rights create vested incumbents who lack incentive to adopt new technology (lest it cause disruption and threaten their power), while discourage investment by the rest of the population with the risk of expropriation.[^8]  This limits the ability of economies to industrialize. Not to mention that, as Michael Kremer has found and I have reaffirmed in my own research, ideas are generated from large populations, not small groups.[^9]

But we should not only conceive good institutions as equal rights to property and free contract. We should shift to a more precise yet broader definition of equal rights. Here, I broadly speak of two types of rights. Negative rights, i.e., rights to non-interference from others when one contracts and accrues property, but also when one expresses oneself, joins religions, and associates with others. The second type are positive rights, as negative rights would need to be enforced through courts and by executives (i.e., implying a positive right to law enforcement). Wary of abuse, one would want constraints on such enforcers, such as democratic rights for selecting the head of state. Using AJR’s data on settler mortality as an instrument, I estimate that moving across the interquartile range on Freedom House’s civil liberties and democracy indices can increase GDP per capita by 12 and 24 times, respectively (see Table 2).

That equal positive rights in the form of enforcement and democracy are necessary should not be foreign. Robert Nozick famously argued that the even a nightwatchmen state must enforce property rights for *everyone*.[^10]  Meanwhile, as Engerman and Sokoloff have found, states with more equal political rights in the Americas introduced publicly funded schools almost a century earlier, likely due to democratic governments being more receptive to the benefits of public goods such as education.[^11] This suggests that a positive right to a vote can be critical to human capital accumulation. In addition to enforcement and voting, competent governance that is impartial to the lobbying of distributional coalitions requires regulators with access to robust research. In that sense, a right to contract might imply a right to robust funding for public research, such as that done by the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The aforementioned positive rights aside, do economists have reason to be concerned with, in addition to property rights, negative rights such as that to free conscience, association, and even speech? I believe they deserve attention as the only solution to disagreement and conflict. When two parties disagree on the relative value of any given two ways of lives, the only equal solution is to not impose either on the other. In that sense, rights to live one’s life without interference from any other, whether that be a state or one’s family or community, are the only solution to value disagreements inherent to any society. Insofar as picking the set of institutions that further peaceful social cooperation aids growth, all else equal, having liberal rights must be a necessary condition for prosperity.
