## Working Papers

### [The Causal Effect of Regulation on Economic Growth: Evidence From the US States](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_olson.pdf)
I'm writing a paper with **[Patrick McLaughlin](https://www.mercatus.org/scholars/patrick-mclaughlin)** on using state age to create an exogenous variation in regulatory accumulation. This project leverages the QuantGov project's **[State RegData](https://www.reghub.ai/data/bulk)**.

## Essays

### [Most U.S. Government Borrowing Just Pays for More Borrowing](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/most-u-s-government-borrowing-just-pays-for-more-borrowing/)
Nearly 40 percent of U.S. government debt today was issued just to cover interest on previous debt, and this problem is poised to worsen as recent borrowing accrues interest and Congress further cuts revenue. **Read more at [Progressive Policy Institute](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/most-u-s-government-borrowing-just-pays-for-more-borrowing/)**

## Works in Progress

### How Complex Has the Tax Code Become? A Measure Derived from Tax Liability
Using publicly-available consumer expenditure data and NBER's TAXSIM program, I construct a direct empirical measure of tax code complexity that encompasses the incidence of all federal and state taxes and the utilization of all deductions and credits.
<br>
<br>

### How Monopolistic is iMessage?
To what extent does iMessage confer a monopolistic advantage to Apple? I estimate how much the service changes the demand elasticity for iPhones.
<br>
<br>

### Social Security: Cost-Benefit Measured as Expected Spending Per Unit of Risk Reduction
I investigate whether various Social Security programs, in conjunction, provide additional value of risk insurance per dollar that is overlooked by separate evaluations of each program. I am using Health and Retirement Study panel data to examine how much the beneficiaries of retirement and disability income payments overlap.
<br>
<br>

### [What Is the Cause of Interest Rate Volatility in Interbank Markets?](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)
I demonstrate in this analysis that contrary to conventional wisdom, interest rate volatility isn't caused by liquidity crunches subsequent to initial public offerings. [Read more](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)

### Income Mobility and Regulation: Evidence from Canadian Immigrants
Using a panel of measures of immigrant mobility from Statistics Canada and a shift-share instrument, we measure how much liberalization affects immigrants' economic outcomes.

## Past Projects

### [Web Scraper for Subsidized Housing Transaction Data](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)
The Housing Authority's data on subsidized housing transactions is notoriously difficult to access as the data must be requested by month, each with a separate web form. So I developed a scraper that automatically submits forms and gathers transaction count in each month into one spreadsheet. 

Built with Python and Selenium. Check it out here: [https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)

### [Visualization of the Hong Kong's Forex Reserves](https://github.com/johnthwong/hkma)
After a drop in the balances of accounts held at the central bank by commercial banks (aka "Aggregate Balance") in the summer of 2022, there was **[panic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/hong-kong-liquidity-shrinks-50-since-may-amid-currency-defense)** that Hong Kong's currency peg with the USD would break. In response, I wrote an internal report on why "Aggregate Balance" is insignificant and not worth freaking out about.
<br>
<br>
This project uses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's JSON API. Data manipulation and visualization are done with R's dplyr and ggplot libraries.

### [Give US Public Housing Residents the Right to Buy Their Flat](https://johnthwong.github.io/page_tpo)
I submitted a policy memo to the Federation of American Scientists' call for federal policy ideas for increasing housing supply. By selling public housing units, we can unlock currently non-transferrable land value, increase homeownership, create new wealth that accrues to the poor, improve state and local public finances, free up units under the Faircloth Limit, and most of all, increase housing supply.

## Non-Econ Projects

### [Reclassifying Civil Servants as Political Appointees Is Just Bad](https://www.progressivepolicy.org/blogs/trumps-schedule-f-would-transform-the-civil-service-to-weaponize-government/)
I co-authored a short piece, published with Progressive Policy Institute, highlighting the *most* insidious part of the 45th's agenda for a potential second term: Schedule F.

### [Can a Coherent Free Speech Regime Allow Incitement?](https://philpapers.org/rec/WONCRM)
My political philosophy thesis where I do conceptual analysis on legal rights. Received an A+. As of August 2024, it has been downloaded over 200 times(!), placing it in the top decile of all political philosophy papers.
