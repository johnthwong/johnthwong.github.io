  As a policy-oriented data scientist, I use machine learning, web scraping, and data visualization to analyze stabilization, regulatory, and housing policy, in addition to authoritarianism.

  I've worked with government agencies, legislators, and developers. I am currently a Research Fellow with the Mercatus Center's international trade team, focusing on security issues relating to trade in services.
