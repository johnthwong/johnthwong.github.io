## Estimating the Cost of Regulatory Accumulation: US States' Age as Identification Strategy
I'm writing a paper with [Dr. Patrick McLaughlin](https://www.mercatus.org/scholars/patrick-mclaughlin) on using state age to create an exogenous variation in regulatory accumulation. This project leverages QuantGov's [State RegData](https://www.reghub.ai/data/bulk).

## [Web Scraper for Subsidized Housing Transaction Data](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)
The Housing Authority's data on subsidized housing transactions is notoriously difficult to access as the data must be requested by month, each with a separate web form. So I developed a scraper that automatically submits forms and gathers transaction count in each month into one spreadsheet. 

Built with Python and Selenium. Check it out here: [https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)

## [Mandate Banks to Use the Discount Window](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)
I wrote in a policy memo in December 2022 that the HKMA (Hong Kong's central bank) should regularly mandate random banks to use the discount window (DW). This would prevent fluctuations in interbank borrowing costs, which hurts both mortgage borrowers and banks. [Read more](https://johnthwong.github.io/pdf/paper_dw.pdf)

## [Visualization of the Hong Kong's Forex Reserves](https://github.com/johnthwong/hkma)
After a drop in the balances of accounts held at the central bank by commercial banks (aka "Aggregate Balance") in the summer of 2022, there was [panic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/hong-kong-liquidity-shrinks-50-since-may-amid-currency-defense) that Hong Kong's currency peg with the USD would break. In response, I wrote an internal report on why "Aggregate Balance" is insignificant and not worth freaking out about.

This project parses JSON data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Data manipulation and visualization are done with R's dplyr and ggplot libraries.

## [Give US Public Housing Residents the Right to Buy Their Flat](https://johnthwong.github.io/page_tpo)
I recently wrote a policy memo for the Federation of American Scientists' call for federal policy ideas for increasing housing supply. By selling public housing units, we can unlock currently non-transferrable land value, increase homeownership, create new wealth that accrues to the poor, improve state and local public finances, free up units under the Faircloth Limit, and most of all, increase housing supply.
