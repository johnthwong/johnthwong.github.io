- title: TPC Tariff Rules Engine
  description: "To analyze rapidly-changing and complex tariff policies, I built a program that estimates a tariff rate for each product from each origin, for each policy, each day—-resulting in 10 billion tariff rates per simulation. This is supported by a YAML-based rule-encoding system that requires no code for adding new policies."

- title: TPC Tariff Supply Chain Model
  description: "Tariffs on final goods are determined by tariffs on their intermediate inputs. We use input-output tables to map how goods feed into one another, and estimate final burden and price changes."

- title: Macroeconomic Agent-Based Model
  description: "A macroeconomy simulated with two types of software agents: households that decide whom to buy from and work for, and firms that decide headcount, wages, and prices. This is a Lengnick model, which shows that even without exogenous shocks, recessions can just emerge from economic agents temporarily failing to coordinate with each other."

- title: Agent-Based General Equilibrium Model
  description: "An agent-based model of a general bilateral exchange problem of any A agents and any N goods. This model uses boundedly rational agents, in the sense that the agents iteratively make trades without knowing the optimal quantities that maximize their utility. It can obtain a decentralized, numerical solution to a general equilibrium problem."
