- title: The Problem With Historical Instrumental Variables
  description: >
    Many instrumental variable papers that identify treatment variations over
    long time periods are misspecified. I use difference equations, VAR
    representations, and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate this. I also
    propose a remedial two-stage-least-squares specification to correct for
    bias.

    QuantGov project's State RegData.
