## Dear HKMA: Mandate Banks to Use the Discount Window
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA, or Hong Kong's central bank) should institute randomized mandatory borrowing, i.e., regularly mandate random banks to use the discount window (DW).[^1]

The rationale is as follows: the Hong Kong Interbank Offering Rate (HIBOR, or the city's benchmark rate) often breaches the Base Rate, the interest rate at which the HKMA lends. This should not happen, as the Base Rate theoretically sets a ceiling on the HIBOR. A bank seeking HKD would have no reason to borrow from a lender that charges more than the HKMA.

### Ruling out the main suspect
The common explanation offered for HIBOR spikes is initial public offerings (IPOs). Hong Kong is a common destination for companies to list their shares to raise funds. When an IPO closes, investors who successfully purchase shares must collectively make transfers to the fundraiser on the same day, during which the city’s banks may borrow cash in large quantities to make payments.[^3]

But I found that breaches occur even during days when there were no IPOs,[^4] leaving DW stigma as the most likely explanation.[^5] One likely reason for stigma is that utilizing the HKMA's lending programs might suggest to investors that the borrowing bank is unable to convince other banks to lend. Investors could in turn assume that the bank is financially distressed and divest.

Mandatory borrowing would eliminate DW stigma among banks by making voluntary borrowers indistinguishable from the involuntary and rendering any speculation on DW activity by the market unproductive.

### Alternatives are ineffective
Mandatory borrowing would be more effective than two alternatives. The first is increasing DW opacity. The Fed currently does not disclose borrower identity for two years, yet DW stigma still exists among US banks. The second is lowering the Base Rate: similar cuts by the Fed [failed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X15001452) to stimulate DW usage in the wake of the '08 Financial Crisis.

### Less breaches, less mortgage overpayment
The foremost benefit to a destigmatized DW would be to save homeowners money. Overnight yield spikes can drive a parallel shift in the yield curve. Given that most mortgages in Hong Kong reference the one-month HIBOR, homeowners would overpay. There were 37 days between 2019-20 with upward-sloping yield curves and HIBOR breaches simultaneously. I estimated that mortgage borrowers overpaid between US$15.1 million to US$92.4 million in interest across these days.[^7]

### More productive investing
There are potential costs and benefits to financial actors as well. [Lab evidence](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/33/12/5630/5835290?redirectedFrom=fulltext) shows that although such a policy would cost liquid banks due to additional interest paid, it would also benefit solvent banks undergoing illiquidity through lower borrowing costs and also equity holders, who could no longer unproductively discriminate against solvent banks using the DW. A destigmatized DW would create net welfare gain; stable interest rates would do more good than harm.

Black dotted lines underscore days where HONIA exceeded the ceiling rate. Though HIBOR is till common parlance in local markets, financial markets have begun a transition away from HIBOR to HONIA since 2020.

[^4]: Other damning evidence: IPOs usually cause short-term rates to rise above long-term ones (leading to an “inverted yield curve”). But no inversion occurred during 17 of the 37 HIBOR spikes observed between 2019-20, i.e., borrowing costs for different maturities increased in tandem (Figure 2, purple dashed lines), which suggests IPOs are not the cause. **What's more:** IPO activity is supposed to highly correlate with amounts borrowed from the HKMA. But as Figure 2 shows, HIBOR spikes which did not lead to inversion also happened to coincide with dampened borrowing, meaning that not only can IPOs be ruled out as the cause for these spikes, but also that whatever is causing these spikes is also correlated with discount window usage.

[^6]: The daily HKMA discount window borrowing is plotted in red in this selected time period. Green dashed lines mark days with HIBOR spikes with yield inversion (one-day rate higher than one-month rate). Purple dashed lines mark spikes without yield inversion. HIBOR spikes without yield inversion were not observed in any time period between 2015 to present. Discount window and HIBOR data are published by the HKMA on [https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/data-publications-and-research/data-and-statistics/daily-monetary-statistics/](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/data-publications-and-research/data-and-statistics/daily-monetary-statistics/).

[^7]: Spikes are defined as ‘mortgage-affecting’ if yields did not invert on the day of the spike. The low-end estimation is made by multiplying the volume of mortgages outstanding on the day by the percentage of new mortgages which refer to the HIBOR (this operation gives an approximation of total HIBOR-referencing mortgages outstanding), which is then multiplied by the deviation between one-day HIBOR (measured by HONIA) and the HKMA’s ceiling rate. The ceiling rate of the HKMA is for one-day borrowing only, so we can only approximate how this ceiling on one-day borrowing would restrict the one-month borrowing cost. This method assumes that deviations for daily and monthly rates are identical. The high-end estimation substitutes the one-day HIBOR-ceiling rate deviation with the deviation from one-month HIBOR and one-month LIBOR. The limitation of this method is that counterfactual monthly HIBOR borrowing costs can itself deviate from LIBOR due to various factors, such as overall banking system liquidity and terms of trade. I also assume that outstanding mortgages whose repayment is due on each working day of the month is equal. HKD figures are converted to USD at a rate of 7.8 HKD per USD. Monthly mortgage data is published by the HKMA on [https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/data-publications-and-research/data-and-statistics/monthly-statistical-bulletin/](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/data-publications-and-research/data-and-statistics/monthly-statistical-bulletin/).
