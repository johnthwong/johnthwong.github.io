  I use microsimulation, structural econometrics, and causal inference to conduct macroeconomic research and analyze public policy.
  <br>
  I've worked with government agencies, legislators, and property developers. I am currently a Fiscal Policy Fellow at Progressive Policy Institute. I am also a Fellow with Mercatus Center.
