  As a policy-oriented data scientist, I use machine learning, web scraping, and data visualization to analyze the macro economy, regulations, foreign policy, and more.

  I've worked as a consultant for government agencies, legislators, and developers in Hong Kong. I am currently a Fellow at the Mercatus Center.
