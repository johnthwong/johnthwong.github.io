## Visualization of the Hong Kong's Reserves

After a drop in the balances of accounts held at the central bank by commercial banks (aka "Aggregate Balance") in the summer of 2022, there was [panic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/hong-kong-liquidity-shrinks-50-since-may-amid-currency-defense) that Hong Kong's currency peg with the USD would break. In response, I wrote an internal report on why "Aggregate Balance" is insignificant and not worth freaking out about.

This project parses JSON data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Data manipulation and visualization are done with R's dplyr and ggplot libraries.
